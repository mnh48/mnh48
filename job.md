### Current source of income

I'm currently __unemployed__, and I'm looking for vacancies in computer science and technology fields. I applied a few companies but they don't want to accept gender non-conforming people to work with them, with most of them will only agree to interview me if I would ignore my own real gender and stick to my outdated legal gender that I could not update legally because of government's refusal to acknowledge our existence. 


### Company I'm looking for

Company that I look for must have at least a written policy that clearly states about protection against discrimination, especially policy that could protect gender non-conforming employees including transgenders and non-binary. Especially since I'm a transnonbinary and such policy is needed to protect us when the government do not protect us.

So many of the companies that I had looked through to apply for jobs so far doesn't have such policy, and so I don't feel safe to apply for jobs in their companies even if there are many positions that I'm interested in. For the few companies that I tried anyway, I got very bad feedbacks.
