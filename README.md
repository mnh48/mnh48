I'm Yaya MNH48, a Malay language translator who code in my free time. My motto is ‚Äúembrace the modern world while retaining the Malay culture‚Äù.

#### Technical projects I'm working on
- Jawi Font ([jawi-mnh48/jawifont](https://github.com/jawi-mnh48/jawifont)) : Edited version of Arabic font files to add support for Jawi alphabets. Jawi is the older and still living script for Malay language.
- MNH48 Beringin ([jawi-mnh48/mnh48-beringin](https://github.com/jawi-mnh48/mnh48-beringin)) : Attempt to create a font to display Beringin alphabets. Beringin is a constructed script for Malay and Indonesian languages.

#### Non-technical projects I'm working on
- Rearranging my Discord server structure
- Writing draft of contents for my websites
- Finalizing the details of my identity for my upcoming virtual YouTuber (vtuber) videos

#### Current source of income
I'm currently __unemployed__, if you're seeking for employee with computing science background in Malaysia **and** your company has policies against discrimination, especially policy that could protect transgenders, then do contact me. All the companies that I had looked through to apply for jobs so far doesn't have such policy, and so I don't feel safe to apply for jobs in their companies even if there are many positions that I'm interested in.

I have Bachelor of Computer Science (Hons.) from Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor; and Diploma in Computer Science from Universiti Teknologi MARA, Arau, Perlis. I prefer vanilla web development or software programming, but I will accept any other positions if it's good enough and worth the wages offered.

#### Current spending
Most of my money goes to paying for my room rental, which is where I'm staying in, the room where there is bed I sleep on. It's the cheapest option in the city with high cost of living, cheap that there's not even dedicated toilet and so I need to use the shared common area's toilet instead.
